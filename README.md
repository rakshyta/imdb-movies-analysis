**Project Description:**
The project aimed to analyse factors influencing the success of movies on IMDB. Success was defined by high IMDB ratings. The objective was to provide insights for stakeholders in the movie industry to make informed decisions for future projects. The project covered genres, movie durations, languages, directors, and budgets as potential factors affecting movie ratings.

**Approach:**

1.  Data Collection and Cleaning: The IMDB movie dataset was obtained and pre-processed. Missing values were handled, duplicates removed, and removing unwanted attributes.

2.  Data Analysis Tasks:  The project followed a structured sequence of tasks:
- Movie Genre Analysis:  Genre distribution and impact on IMDB scores were analysed.
- Movie Duration Analysis:  Movie durations distribution and its relationship with IMDB scores were explored.
- Language Analysis:  Distribution of movies by language and its impact on IMDB scores were examined.
- Director Analysis:  Top directors' influence on IMDB scores and their contribution to movie success were studied.
- Budget Analysis:  Correlation between budgets and gross earnings, along with movies with high profit margins, were investigated.

3.  Five 'Whys' Approach:  This technique was applied to delve deeper into findings, seeking to understand the underlying reasons behind observed trends.
